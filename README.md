## Arithmetic

Goal:
To write code to create functions capable of different arithmetic operations.

## Instructions

- Open [arithmetic.js](./arithmetic.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of each function defined to accomplish the following:

  - `add` returns the result of `num1` plus `num2`.

  - `subtract` returns the result of `num1` minus `num2`.

  - `multiply` returns the result of `num1` times `num2`.

  - `divide` returns the result of `num1` divided by `num2`.
