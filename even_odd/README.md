## Goal

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that prints even numbers from 0 to a given number.

## Instructions üöß

- Open [even_odd.js](./even.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `logEvenNums` function to achieve the following:

    - Print all even numbers from `0` up to the given `nums` argument, inclusive.

  &mdash; For example, given the number `6` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

  ```bash

  Result

        0Ô∏è‚É£
        2Ô∏è‚É£
        4Ô∏è‚É£
        6Ô∏è‚É£


  ```
